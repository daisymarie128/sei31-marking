#### General comments
LOVED YOUR GAMEBOY!! 😻👾😻👾😻
Your final project was well polished and very presentable. Your CSS work has gone above and beyond and it really shows. This is a great project for the meet and greet. You should be stoked with what you've made it's awesome!

The 3D effects you had on the gameboy was uch a nice touch, plus your redesign for when it goes to mobile mode is great. awesome awesome work!

#### Code feedback
You should include a readme in all repos that you make. (only just saw the one in your web folder - but it's quite hidden and you should have one on the top level of repo)

Things you should include are a one sentence description of what the repo does. The frameworks/languages you used. How to run your project locally.

It was great to see you using `alt` tags on images, this is a great start to accessability on the web, keep it up 👏

Nice implementation using `bcrypt` for passwords 👍

Also consider sticking with a consistant code style, in some places your using `var` others `let` without the need for their different hoisting relations.

You could also replace some `let`'s with `const` as they are never being re-written.
