#### General comments
You presented really well, and got a good working site, good job üëç

#### Code feedback
You've got a great start to a good readme, you've covered some of the very important parts like adding languages and frameworks that you've used. Along with an image of what the application looks like.

Would be great to also include instructions on how to run the application locally.

You did a great job using rails templates. 

Great work on getting the mail service to work.
